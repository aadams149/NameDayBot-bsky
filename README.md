# Name Days Bluesky Bot

This bot posts the name days for various European countries and the United States to Bluesky. I wrote an original R script which queries data from [this repo](https://github.com/xnekv03/nameday-api), links it to full country names, flags, and capital cities, then finds the time zone for each country's capital city and generates text files with content to be posted to Bluesky just after midnight in that time zone.

This bot is a personal project I undertook in order to learn a bit about Typescript and workflow automation, as well as data processing with time zones and including emojis in text. You can check out my other bot [here](https://github.com/aadams149/OPMStatusBot-bsky).

To build this bot, I used Phil Nash's [excellent template repository](github.com/philnash/bsky-bot). If you have any questions about the bot, feel free to reach out to me at namedaybot@alexanderjadams.com.
